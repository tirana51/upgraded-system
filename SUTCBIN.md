# Problem Statement
Babu bhaiya is a mathematician who is working on a set of integers which contains a total of N integers. He wants to know how many distinct integers are present their in the set, also he wants to know how many times each integers appears in the set. Your task is to print the sum of each distinct integer and its count (how many times it has appeared in the set) in the same order as the integer first appear in the set. Each sum of integer and its count should be sperated by a space from one another.

## Input
The first line will contain the value of N. The second line will contain N integers seperated by space.

## Output
Print the sum of each distinct integer and its count with single space in between them in a single line.

## Constraints
0<=N<=2000

0<= (Each integer) <=10^9
